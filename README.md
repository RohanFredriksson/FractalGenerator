# FractalGenerator
#### Description
A command line based fractal renderer, which uses multiprocessing to quickly render awesome images of fractals. The user has full control over the rendering of the image being able to choose render size, location, zoom, iterations, and even the colormap used. Currently there is only support for rendering the Mandelbrot Set but there are plans to include other fractals.

This repository is no longer being worked on. I have continued development of fractal programs in my new project [FractalExplore](https://github.com/RohanFredriksson/FractalExplore). This project further improves upon this project, allowing for real time rendering of the same fractals with much more customisation.
#### Usage
To structure of the command line input is as follows:
```
python3 main.py xPosition yPosition zoom imageWidth imageHeight iterations colormap [location]
```
The following image was generated by using the following command:
```
python3 main.py -0.3702461674528304 0.6487461306014151 1024 1920 1080 600 instagram preview.png
```
